If after the expiration of this grace period Customer/Presenter has not made any payment on Customer/Presenter’s Subscription, Customer/Presenter’s non-payment may result in suspension of the Software Services to Customer/Presenter and subsequent termination of Customer/Presenter’s Subscription.
                            <br />
                            (ii) If payment cannot be charged to Customer/Presenter’s credit card or Customer/Presenter’s charge is returned for any reason, including through a chargeback, Licensor reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to suspend or terminate Customer/Presenter’s access and account, thereby terminating this Agreement and all obligations of Licensor hereunder. If a charge made to Customer/Presenter’s credit card is declined, Licensor may make up to five (5) attempts to bill that card over a thirty (30) day period.
                            <br />
                            (iii) If Customer/Presenter wishes to reactivate his/her Subscription after such termination, there will be no setup or reactivation fees, provided, however, accounts terminated for non-payment will be reactivated only on receipt of the full amount past due and a written request to reinstate the account. When an expired account is reactivated, the new term begins on the date of reactivation. When an expired Subscription is reactivated, the new term begins on the date of reactivation.
                            <br />
                            (iv) Licensor reserves the right to cancel automatic renewals upon fifteen (15) days prior notice to Customer/Presenter (which may be sent by email to the address Customer/Presenter has most recently provided to Licensor).

Licensee shall cover all fees and processing expenses for charge backs, frauds, and refunds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Licensee shall be solely responsible for any value added taxes collections, payments and related registrations arising in any way out of or relating to this Agreement. If and when Licensor has the legal obligation to collect such taxes, Licensor will invoice Licensee the amount of such taxes, and Licensee will pay such amount unless Licensee provides Licensor with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Licensee will provide Licensor with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority or such other evidence as is reasonably requested by Licensor to establish that such taxes have been paid. The parties shall reasonably cooperate to more accurately determine each party’s tax liability and to minimize such liability to the extent legally permissible.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Receiving Party is required by applicable securities laws, rules or regulations or stock exchange requirements to disclose or describe Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party, it will use reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party before complying with such laws, rules and regulations. The Receiving Party agrees to furnish, disclose or describe only that portion of the Confidential Information, which is legally required (in the opinion of its counsel).
